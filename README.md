# Driving In Tehran (The Old Persian game that is a pile of shit)
Old Persian game that looks terrible, embezzlement, source-rivaling "physics engines" and pirated audio from FIFA and a mod from Need For Speed


# Prologue

A user named [Sepi](https://www.youtube.com/@seP4) documented on the game, discovering bad stuff about the companies involved in the game, the building of the company belonging to doctors, etc. You can watch that video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFDYvlm7geU&t=115s)

# Install 

To install this monstrosity, if you're on any os before Windows XP, this may work for you. Use VirtualBox and make the CPU, RAM and display to the max!

Insert the ISO into your computer but don't install it yet. Get the Key Generator and the Serial into the install file (as you will need it) insert the key gen and serial number into the official DIT install exe and it should work for you.


# All in all

This game is shit, if you decide to play despite the terrible controlls, good luck.
